### About Version 6.0 :round_pushpin:
This version was created for the resolution of [desafio 08](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/bootcamp-launchbase-desafios-08/blob/master/desafios/08-apresentacao-organizacao-receitas-foodfy.md) from Launchbase bootcamp.

In this challenge we sorted the recipes from the newest to the oldest in the site homepage and in the recipes page. But when the user searched for a recipe, it was sorted from the last updated ones to the oldest updated.
<br><br/>

We also created a procedure that automatically updated the recipe "updated_at" when the recipe was edited.
