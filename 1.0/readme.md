### About Version 1.0 :round_pushpin:
This version was created for the resolution of [desafio 02](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/bootcamp-launchbase-desafios-02/blob/master/desafios/02-foodfy.md) from Launchbase bootcamp.

For this challenge, we were asked to train the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript teached in the second module of the bootcamp. Also, the images and the layout specifications were given to us in the challenge material.
