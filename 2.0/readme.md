### About Version 2.0 :round_pushpin:
This version was created for the resolution of [desafio 03](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/bootcamp-launchbase-desafios-03/blob/master/desafios/03-refatorando-foodfy.md) from Launchbase bootcamp.

For this challenge, we were asked to re-build the code of the previous exercise(Foodfy site), but now using Node for running a server and a Js file to store some informations of the site. We also refatored some parts of the code, like using Nunjucks to replace HTML and make the code more dinamic.
