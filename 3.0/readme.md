### About Version 3.0 :round_pushpin:
This version was created for the resolution of [desafio 04](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/bootcamp-launchbase-desafios-04/blob/master/desafios/04-admin-foodfy.md) from Launchbase bootcamp.

In this challenge, we moved the data from a Js file to a Json file using **fs** from Node. We also added an admnistrative area acessible using */admin* on routes. With these routes it was possible to add, edit and delete (CRUD) recipes.
