### About Version 4.0 :round_pushpin:
This version was created for the resolution of [desafio 05](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/bootcamp-launchbase-desafios-05/blob/master/desafios/05-persistindo-dados-foodfy.md) from Launchbase bootcamp.

In this challenge, we moved the data from a Json file to a Postgres Database. We also added chefs to the site and to the administrative area. Now, we have to add a chef before adding a recipe.

We can delete any recipe, but we can only delete a chief if He hasn't any recipe registered in his name.
