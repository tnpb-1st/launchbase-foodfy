### About Version 5.0 :round_pushpin:
This version was created for the resolution of [desafio 07](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/bootcamp-launchbase-desafios-07/blob/master/desafios/07-foodfy-envio-imagens.md) from Launchbase bootcamp.

In this challenge we made it possible for the admin to upload and manage both recipes and chefs pictures using a mini-gallery system created by us. We also learned how to create triggers and procedures in Postbird and how to create references in Postgres.
<br><br/>

Now, when we delete a chef, we also delete his/her recipes and the files of the chef avatar and the files of the recipes.
